Study Design: Open-label, cluster-randomized controlled trial.
Location: 28 tuberculosis units across 4 districts in Jharkhand, India.
Participants: Household contacts of 2800 patients with microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis.
Randomization: Tuberculosis units allocated 1:1 to control or intervention group using block randomization.
Interventions:
Both groups received food rations (1200 kcal, 52 grams of protein/day) for 6 months.
Intervention group also received monthly food rations and micronutrients (750 kcal, 23 grams of protein/day).
Follow-up: Active follow-up until July 31, 2022.
Outcome Measurement: Incident tuberculosis (all forms), ascertained by independent medical staff.
Statistical Methods: Cox proportional hazards model and Poisson regression via generalized estimating equations.
Registration: CTRI-India, CTRI/2019/08/020490.
Findings:

Enrollment: 10,345 household contacts.
Completion of Assessment:
Intervention group: 5328 (94.8% of 5621).
Control group: 4283 (90.7% of 4724).
Baseline Co-prevalent Tuberculosis: 31 cases (0.3% of 10,345).
Incident Tuberculosis:
Total cases: 218 (2.1% of 10,345) over 21,869 person-years.
Control group: 122 cases (2.6% of 4712 contacts at risk), incidence rate 1.27 per 100 person-years.
Intervention group: 96 cases (1.7% of 5602 contacts), incidence rate 0.78 per 100 person-years.
Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratios:
All forms of tuberculosis: 0.61 (95% CI 0.43–0.85).
Microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis: 0.52 (95% CI 0.35–0.79).
Relative Reduction:
Tuberculosis incidence (all forms): 39%.
Microbiologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis: 48%.
Nutritional Supplementation: Estimated 30 households (111 contacts) needed to prevent one incident tuberculosis case.
Conclusion:

The study is the first randomized trial showing that nutritional support can significantly reduce tuberculosis incidence (39–48%) among household contacts over a 2-year period.
This biosocial intervention could help accelerate tuberculosis reduction in communities affected by both tuberculosis and undernutrition.
