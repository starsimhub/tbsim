# SFT (System Functional Testing) Validation Suite

This directory contains validation scripts for testing the effectiveness and functionality of TB simulation interventions, particularly the BCG intervention.

## Overview

The SFT validation suite ensures that interventions are working correctly and making measurable differences in TB disease modeling indicators compared to baseline scenarios.

## Contributing

When adding new validation tests:

1. Follow the naming convention: `validation_[intervention_name].py`
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Test both individual and population-level impacts
4. Provide clear pass/fail criteria
