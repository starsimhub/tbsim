class TPTInitiation(ss.Intervention):
    """
    Tuberculosis Preventive Therapy (TPT) intervention for household contacts of care-seeking individuals.

    This intervention identifies households where at least one member sought care, and offers TPT to all
    other members of those households who meet the following eligibility criteria:
    
    Requirements:
        - Must have been in a previous intervention which updates sought_care, non_symptomatic, and symptomatic attributes
    
    Eligibility criteria:
        - Must reside in a household where at least one member sought care
        - Must not have symptoms (non_symptomatic = True and symptomatic = False)
        - Must not have active TB (not in ACTIVE_PRESYMP, ACTIVE_SMPOS, ACTIVE_SMNEG, or ACTIVE_EXPTB states)
        - Must not already be on TB treatment themselves
        - Must be within the specified age_range (list: [min_age, max_age], default: [0, 100])
        - Must meet HIV status threshold (if set and hiv_positive attribute present)
    
    Treatment logic:
        - A Bernoulli trial (`p_tpt`) is used to determine which eligible individuals initiate TPT
        - If initiated, individuals are flagged as `on_tpt` for the treatment duration (`tpt_treatment_duration`)
        - After completing treatment, individuals become protected (tb.state = TBS.PROTECTED) for a fixed duration (`tpt_protection_duration`)
        - Protection is tracked using `tpt_protection_until` and is automatically removed when expired (tb.state set to TBS.NONE)
    
    Parameters:
        p_tpt (float or ss.Bernoulli): Probability of initiating TPT for an eligible individual
        age_range (list): [min_age, max_age] for eligibility (default: [0, 100])
        hiv_status_threshold (bool): If True, only HIV-positive individuals are eligible (requires 'hiv_positive' attribute)
        tpt_treatment_duration (float): Duration of TPT administration (e.g., 3 months)
        tpt_protection_duration (float): Duration of post-treatment protection (e.g., 2 years)
        start (ss.date): Start date for offering TPT
        stop (ss.date): Stop date for offering TPT

    Results tracked:
        n_eligible (int): Number of individuals meeting criteria
        n_tpt_initiated (int): Number of individuals who started TPT

    Notes:
        - Requires 'hhid', 'on_tpt', 'received_tpt', 'sought_care', 'non_symptomatic', 'symptomatic' attributes on people
        - Assumes household structure is available (e.g., via HouseHoldNet)
        - TB disease model must support 'protected_from_tb', 'tpt_treatment_until', and 'tpt_protection_until' states
        - Protection logic mirrors BCG: tb.state is set to TBS.PROTECTED for the immunity period, then reset to TBS.NONE
        - Uses care-seeking individuals as the index population for household contact tracing
