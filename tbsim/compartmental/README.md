# Compartmental models

This folder implements three versions of the LSHTM model -- the original model in R (`lshtm_ode.R`), an exact translation of the R model into Python (`lshtm_ode.py:TB_ODE()`), and a translation of the Python model into Starsim (`lshtm_ode.py:TB_ODE_SS()`).

See `tests/test_compartmental.py` for related tests.
