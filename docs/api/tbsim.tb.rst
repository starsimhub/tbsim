Model Overview
--------------

The TB disease model implements a comprehensive tuberculosis simulation with the following key features:

**State Structure**
   - **Susceptible States**: NONE (-1) - No TB infection
   - **Latent States**: LATENT_SLOW (0), LATENT_FAST (1) - TB infection without symptoms
   - **Active States**: ACTIVE_PRESYMP (2), ACTIVE_SMPOS (3), ACTIVE_SMNEG (4), ACTIVE_EXPTB (5)
   - **Outcome States**: DEAD (8) - TB-related death, PROTECTED (100) - BCG protection

**Disease Progression**
   - Stochastic state transitions with time-dependent probabilities
   - Latent to active progression with different rates for slow/fast progressors
   - Active disease progression through pre-symptomatic, symptomatic, and treatment phases
   - Natural clearance and recovery mechanisms

**Transmission Dynamics**
   - Person-to-person transmission based on infectious states
   - Network-based transmission through social contacts
   - Age and risk factor dependent transmission rates

**Treatment Integration**
   - Treatment initiation and management
   - Treatment effectiveness and adherence modeling
   - Treatment outcome tracking

Key Methods
-----------

**State Transitions**
   - `p_latent_to_presym()`: Latent to pre-symptomatic progression
   - `p_presym_to_clear()`: Natural clearance from pre-symptomatic state
   - `p_presym_to_active()`: Progression to active disease
   - `p_active_to_clear()`: Recovery from active disease
   - `p_active_to_death()`: TB-related mortality

**Treatment Management**
   - `start_treatment()`: Initiate treatment for eligible individuals
   - `step_die()`: Handle TB-related deaths

**Results Tracking**
   - Prevalence and incidence monitoring
   - State-specific population counts
   - Treatment coverage and outcomes
   - Mortality and recovery rates

Usage Examples
-------------

Basic TB simulation:

.. code-block:: python

   from tbsim import TB
   import starsim as ss
   
   sim = ss.Sim(diseases=TB())
   sim.run()

With custom parameters:

.. code-block:: python

   from tbsim import TB
   
   # Customize TB parameters
   tb = TB(pars={
       'beta': 0.5,           # Transmission rate
       'init_prev': 0.01,     # Initial prevalence
       'p_latent_to_active': 0.1,  # Progression rate
       'p_active_to_death': 0.05   # Mortality rate
   })
   
   sim = ss.Sim(diseases=tb)
   sim.run()

Accessing results:

.. code-block:: python

   # Get current state counts
   current_states = tb.state
   infected_count = len(tb.infected)
   active_count = len(tb.active)
   
   # Access results
   results = tb.results
   prevalence = results.prevalence
   incidence = results.incidence
   mortality = results.mortality

State Management
---------------

**State Transitions**
   The model implements a comprehensive state transition system where agents move between different TB states based on:

   - **Natural Progression**: Time-dependent transition probabilities
   - **Treatment Effects**: Modified progression rates under treatment
   - **Network Effects**: Transmission through social contacts
   - **Risk Factors**: Age, comorbidities, and other individual characteristics

**Infection Dynamics**
   - New infections occur through contact with infectious individuals
   - Latent infections can progress to active disease or clear naturally
   - Active disease can lead to treatment, recovery, or death
   - Treatment modifies progression rates and transmission potential

**Population Dynamics**
   - Birth and death processes affect TB dynamics
   - Age-specific risk factors influence disease progression
   - Network structure determines transmission patterns
   - Intervention effects modify disease parameters
