# TBsim docs

## Tutorials

Please see the `tutorials` subfolder.

## Everything else

This folder includes source code for building the docs.

To build the docs, follow these steps:

1.  Make sure the Python dependencies are installed:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  Build the documents with `./mkdocs build` (requires TBsim to be installed as well).

3.  The built documents will be in `./site`.
