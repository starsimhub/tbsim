User Guide
==========

TBsim is a comprehensive tuberculosis simulation framework built on the Starsim platform, designed for modeling TB transmission, natural history, and intervention impacts in realistic populations.

Core Framework
--------------

TBsim leverages the Starsim individual-based modeling framework with the following key capabilities:

**Individual-Based Modeling (IBM)**
   Each person in the simulation is represented as an individual agent with unique characteristics, health states, and behaviors.

**Network-Based Transmission**
   Social connections between individuals are modeled as networks, enabling realistic transmission dynamics through household and community structures.

**Modular Architecture**
   Components can be mixed and matched to create custom simulation scenarios with flexible parameterization.

TB Natural History and Disease States
------------------------------------

TBsim implements a comprehensive TB natural history model with the following disease states:

**Core Disease States**
   - **Susceptible (NONE)**: No TB infection
   - **Latent TB (LATENT_SLOW/FAST)**: Two progression rates for latent infection
   - **Active Pre-symptomatic (ACTIVE_PRESYMP)**: Early active disease before symptoms
   - **Active Symptomatic Smear+ (ACTIVE_SMPOS)**: Most infectious form of TB
   - **Active Symptomatic Smear- (ACTIVE_SMNEG)**: Moderately infectious TB
   - **Extra-pulmonary TB (ACTIVE_EXPTB)**: TB outside the lungs
   - **Protected (PROTECTED)**: Protected state from vaccines or preventive therapy
   - **TB Death (DEAD)**: TB-related mortality

**Transmission Dynamics**
   - Airborne transmission through social networks
   - Smear-based infectiousness (smear+ > smear- > extra-pulmonary)
   - Age-dependent transmission rates
   - Individual transmission heterogeneity
   - Household and community network structures

Diagnostic Capabilities
-----------------------

TBsim includes comprehensive diagnostic modeling with multiple test types:

**Available Diagnostic Tests**
   - **Smear Microscopy**: Traditional sputum smear testing
   - **Xpert MTB/RIF**: Molecular testing for TB and rifampin resistance
   - **MDR Testing**: Multi-drug resistance detection
   - **FujiLAM**: Urine-based testing for HIV+ individuals
   - **CAD CXR**: Computer-aided chest X-ray interpretation
   - **Oral Swab**: Non-sputum based testing

**Diagnostic Features**
   - Age and HIV-specific sensitivity/specificity parameters
   - TB state-specific test performance
   - False negative handling with care-seeking multipliers
   - Enhanced diagnostic interventions with comprehensive result tracking

Treatment and Interventions
---------------------------

**Drug Treatment**
   - **DOTS**: Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course implementation
   - **Latent Treatment**: TB Preventive Therapy (TPT) with multiple regimens
   - **Treatment Success/Failure**: Configurable treatment outcomes
   - **Treatment Relapse**: Post-treatment disease recurrence modeling

**Preventive Interventions**
   - **BCG Vaccination**: Comprehensive BCG protection with age targeting
   - **TB Preventive Therapy (TPT)**: Household-based and individual TPT
   - **Vaccine Campaigns**: Mass vaccination strategies

**Health Seeking Behavior**
   - Configurable care-seeking rates
   - Care-seeking multipliers for different populations
   - Re-seeking behavior after treatment failure
   - Age-dependent health seeking patterns

Disease Connectors and Co-infections
------------------------------------

TBsim includes sophisticated connectors to link TB with other diseases:

**TB-HIV Co-infection**
   - **HIV State Integration**: Uses HIV disease states (ACUTE, LATENT, AIDS) to modify TB progression
   - **CD4-dependent Effects**: TB progression varies with HIV disease stage
   - **ART Effects**: Antiretroviral therapy impacts on TB natural history
   - **Risk Multipliers**: HIV increases TB activation risk (ACUTE: 1.22x, LATENT: 1.90x, AIDS: 3.0x)

**TB-Malnutrition Integration**
   - **Comprehensive Malnutrition Modeling**: BMI-based nutritional status effects
   - **Nutrition-TB Connector**: Nutritional status impacts TB progression and treatment
   - **Supplementation Effects**: Nutritional intervention modeling

Networks and Social Structure
-----------------------------

**Network Types**
   - **Household Networks**: Family and household connections for transmission
   - **Community Networks**: Broader social interactions
   - **Trial-based Networks**: Framework for intervention trials
   - **Contact Networks**: Detailed contact tracing capabilities

**Transmission Networks**
   - Household-based transmission modeling
   - Age-stratified contact patterns
   - Network-based intervention targeting

Running Simulations
------------------

Basic simulation workflow:

1. **Setup**: Configure TB model, networks, and interventions
2. **Initialize**: Create population with demographic data
3. **Run**: Execute simulation with real-time analysis
4. **Analyze**: Process results with comprehensive visualization tools
5. **Export**: Save results for further analysis and reporting

**Example Usage**
   ```python
   import starsim as ss
   from tbsim import TB, DwtAnalyzer
   
   # Create simulation with TB model and analyzer
   sim = ss.Sim(
       diseases=[TB()],
       networks=ss.HouseholdNet(),
       analyzers=[DwtAnalyzer(scenario_name="Baseline")]
   )
   sim.run()
   
   # Generate comprehensive analysis plots
   analyzer = sim.analyzers[0]
   analyzer.sankey_agents()
   analyzer.network_graph()
   analyzer.kaplan_meier()
   ```
