## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### Drug Types Available
1. **DOTS** - Standard Directly Observed Treatment (85% cure rate, $100 cost)
2. **DOTS_IMPROVED** - Enhanced DOTS with better support (90% cure rate, $150 cost)
3. **EMPIRIC_TREATMENT** - Treatment without confirmed sensitivity (70% cure rate, $80 cost)
4. **FIRST_LINE_COMBO** - First-line combination therapy (95% cure rate, $200 cost)
5. **SECOND_LINE_COMBO** - Second-line therapy for MDR-TB (75% cure rate, $500 cost)
6. **THIRD_LINE_COMBO** - Third-line therapy for XDR-TB (60% cure rate, $1000 cost)
7. **LATENT_TREATMENT** - Treatment for latent TB (90% cure rate, $50 cost)

### Cost-Effectiveness Insights
- **LATENT_TREATMENT** is most cost-effective (1.8 cure rate per $100)
- **FIRST_LINE_COMBO** has highest cure rate (95%)
- **DOTS** provides good balance of cost and effectiveness
