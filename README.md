# Tuberculosis Modeling using StarSim (TBSim)

This repository contains the implementation of a new Tuberculosis (TB) Model using the StarSim package. The model aims to simulate the dynamics of TB spread and treatment efficacy under various scenarios.

## Introduction

Tuberculosis is a major global health problem, and understanding its dynamics can help in developing better strategies for control and treatment. This project uses the StarSim package to simulate TB spread in a population, considering factors like transmission rates, treatment efficacy, and social dynamics.

## Features

- **TB Dynamics Simulation:** Models the spread of TB in a given population.
- **Treatment Scenarios:** Evaluates the efficacy of different treatment strategies.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Allows adjustment of various parameters to simulate different scenarios.
- **Visualization Tools:** Includes tools for visualizing the simulation results.
- **IBM and NBM:** Leverages Individual-Based Models and Network-Based Models for more accurate and comprehensive simulations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- StarSim package
- Other dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amath-idm/TBSim.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running s Simulation

1. Navigate to the project directory **tbsim\src**.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python quick_demo.py
   ```
3. running this script should result in a chart being displayed.

## Usage _(TBD)_

- Modify the `config.json` file to set different parameters for the simulation.
- Run the `run_simulation.py` script to start the simulation.
- Use the visualization tools in `visualization.py` to view the results.
